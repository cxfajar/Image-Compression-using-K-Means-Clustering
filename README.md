# 🖼️ Image Compression using K-Means Clustering

This project demonstrates how to use the **K-Means clustering algorithm** for compressing images by reducing the number of distinct colors. It's a practical application of unsupervised machine learning, where pixels are grouped into clusters and recolored based on the nearest centroid, resulting in a compressed image with minimal visual quality loss.
